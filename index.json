The founding editor was Randy Schekman, a 2012 Nobel Prize winner. eLife is renowned for its pioneering and experimental publishing model. After winning the Nobel Prize, Randy Schekman publicly criticized top journals such as CNS (Cell, Science, Nature), saying they were like “limited luxury goods”, causing unnecessary pressure on scientists.\neLife Logo From its inception, in addition to open access, another significant innovation of eLife was the collaborative system for peer review, which means that the reviewers and the editors discuss the opinions together.

This journal focuses on publishing brief re-analyses of published empirical research results.\nThe majority of empirical research papers only report a single main analytical result, which is usually carried out by a single analysis team (often also the team responsible for the experimental design and data collection) according to a single analysis plan. However, the “multi-analyst projects” in recent years have shown that different analysis teams often adopt their own unique methods, resulting in significant differences in conclusions. In fact, there is no single optimal statistical analysis plan, and different reasonable plans may lead to different conclusions. The strong variability of conclusions indicates their vulnerability, which is highly dependent on the specific analysis path. The key issue is that without independent analyses by multiple teams, it is difficult to assess the robustness of the conclusions. We recently proposed that for empirical research with significant scientific or social significance, 2-3 short reanalysis reports completed by independent experts should be attached [1]. To verify the feasibility and cognitive value of this method, we established the “Robustness Report Journal”, dedicated to publishing reanalyses of empirical results. This article outlines the journal’s positioning, workflow, and article format of JRR. We hope that JRR can promote reanalysis to become a routine practice in the field of empirical science.\nJRR requires that the main body of the “Stability Report” should not exceed 500 words (excluding acknowledgments, references, chart explanations and title page). Only one presentation element (either a figure or a table) is allowed, and other supplementary materials must be presented in the form of online appendices. The response from the original author and the editor’s summary are also limited to 500 words and one presentation element, but they do not need to follow the above chapter structure. The article template is available in both Word and LaTeX versions.\n图1 The original intention behind setting the word limit: JRR hopes to encourage mainstream empirical journals to adopt this format, attaching robustness reports to important studies – a 500-word length is comparable to that of a “comment” or “letter to the editor” (most journals are already familiar with such formats), and the implementation cost is extremely low.\n","date":1733097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733097600,"objectID":"24c84e70c9e7eb57faeca555acd3dd7e","permalink":"https://terryzang.github.io/about/post/2024-12-new-publication/","publishdate":"2024-12-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/post/2024-12-new-publication/","section":"about","summary":"This week, a brand-new open-access diamond journal - the Journal of Robustness Reports (abbreviated as JRR) - officially launched (website: https://scipost.org/JRobustRep).
